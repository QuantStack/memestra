Pyls-Memestra
=============

Memestra offers integration with the Python Language Protocol, meaning that you can use it inside different programs like Jupyter Lab or other IDEs that support the protocol.

Pyls-Memestra will run automatically once you install the extension in your program and it will offer support for all functions marked as ``@decorator.deprecated`` in the code.

More about the Pyls-Memestra use and implementation in the official documentation: https://pyls-memestra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
